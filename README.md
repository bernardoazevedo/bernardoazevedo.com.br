# Blog

## What is this?
This is a blog that I made for me.

## Why?
To post my obsidian permanent notes.

## I want to:
- [x] Post my obsidian notes here.
- [x] Build a platform that I can also use on my resume.

## To do:
- [ ] Fix long words that don't wrap in code blocks.
- [ ] Beautify the site...
- [ ] Improve the UX, like spaces between list itens
